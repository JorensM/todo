# Todo list app exercise

This is a basic todo list app to demonstrate my skills with React and React Native.

## Features

* Create, edit and remove todo items
* Search and filtering functionality
* Data persists between app reloads

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

Without doing a native build, you can run the app either on web or with the Expo Go app after you've run `npx expo start`
